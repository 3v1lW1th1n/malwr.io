<p>I am a web developer and Bootstrap expert living in Orlando, Florida. I'm also the creator of a website called <a href="http://startbootstrap.com">Start Bootstrap</a> which is a library of open source themes and templates for the Bootstrap framework. All of the themes on Start Bootstrap were created by me, and they are free to download and use for any purpose!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ironsummitmedia.com">Iron Summit Media Strategies</a> is the business that I own. We work mainly in front-end development for small to medium sized clients, but also provide digital marketing consulting and services for a select group of local, nationwide, and international clients.</p>

<p>Although I am a web developer by trade, my educational background is in business. I currently hold a Bachelor's Degree in Entrepreneurship Management from the University of Central Florida, along with a Master's in Business Administration (MBA) with a certificate in Technology Ventures.</p>

<p>If you have questions about Start Bootstrap, Iron Summit Media Strategies, or anything else, feel free to contact me and I will try to get back to you as soon as possible!</p>
