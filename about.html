<p class="lead">Currently pixel pushing in Orlando, FL. Creator of <a href="https://startbootstrap.com">Start Bootstrap</a>.</p>

<p>I'm an Orlando, FL based designer specializing in <a href="http://getbootstrap.com">Bootstrap</a> based projects. Profesionally, most of my time is spent managing <a href="https://startbootstrap.com">Start Bootstrap</a>, a library of open source themes and templates for Bootstrap, which I created in August 2014 after freelancing for a few years. I now also work with companies on a contractual basis for front end development projects or as a UI/UX consultant.</p>

<p>My educational background is in entrepreneurship, and I received an MBA focusing on Technology Ventures from the University of Central Florida in 2012.</p>

<p>When I'm not staring at a computer screen, you'll most likely find me with some sort of board under my feet while on the water, snow, or concrete.</p>

<p>To get in touch with me, you can <a href="https://github.com/davidtmiller">find me on GitHub</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/davidmillerskt">on Twitter</a>, or you can <a href="https://www.instagram.com/davidmillerswbrd/">follow me on Instagram</a> to see me shred.</p>
