<p>I am a front end web developer and Bootstrap specialist living in Orlando, Florida. I'm the creator of a website called <a href="http://startbootstrap.com">Start Bootstrap</a> which is a library of open source themes and templates for the Bootstrap framework. I personally create and maintain all of the themes available on Start Bootstrap, and they are free to download and use for any purpose!</p>

<p><a href="http://blackrockdigital.io">Blackrock Digital</a> is the web development and digital goods agency that I own and run. Under this name, I serve small to medium sized clients with front end development needs, and produce premium digital goods that are for sale on various online marketplaces.</p>

<p>Although I am a web developer by trade, my educational background is in business having received an MBA from the University of Central Florida.</p>

<p>When I am not working, you can find me practicing and teaching Capoeira, an Afro-Brazilian martial art.</p>

<p>If you have questions about Start Bootstrap, Blackrock Digital, or are interested in booking me for speaking engagements, feel free to contact me and I will try to get back to you as soon as possible!</p>
