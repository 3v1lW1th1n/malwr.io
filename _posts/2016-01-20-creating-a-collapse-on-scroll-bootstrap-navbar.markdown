		<p>Collapsing navigation bars are a very popular design choice, and can add a nice dynamic touch to many types of websites. There are loads of plugins and code snippets out there to help you achieve the effect, but what makes this method unique is that it uses built-in Bootstrap components to create the animated collapse-on-scroll effect rather than using additional third party plugins. This means you wont have to import any extra JavaScript libraries into your project or add any other additional resources other than your core Bootstrap files and jQuery.</p>

		<p>In this short, beginner level code review, we won't be using anything more than the default Bootstrap navbar, a bit of jQuery to activate the Bootstrap Affix plugin, and a little bit of custom CSS. For the more advanced designers out there, feel free to use your CSS pre-processor of choice or any other tools, but for the purposes of this guide I wanted to keep things as simple as possible!</p>

		<p>That being said, here is the collapse-on-scroll Bootstrap navbar that we will be exploring in this post:</p>

		<p>What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that man set foot on the Moon but that they set eye on the earth.</p>

		<p>A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon seeing her beauty, become her protectors rather than her violators. That's how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time. I could not help but love and cherish her.</p>

		<p>For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more valuable than those which divide us.</p>

		<p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

		<p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>

		<p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

		<p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

		<p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
